Pricing and advertising strategies in an e-commerc environment

This report presents an algorithm to study and search for the best joint bidding and pricing strategy
in a particular environment scenario, online markets. Our result is theoretical and presents some simplifications but can be generalized to real case scenarios. We start by presenting the problem and itâ€™s mathematical modeling and then we construct our solution step by step from a smaller problem to the general solution. We will consider an experiment with 3 different classes of customers characterized by specific functions related to the probability of purchasing our item given a price, number of clicks gained and the cost per click for the advertisement campaign. Our simplification is mostly related to the advertisement; indeed, we imagine having an unlimited budget and we do not include in the problem the auction mechanism typical of the advertisement scenario. We intrude a complexity related to the pricing strategy: we suppose that the user will purchase again a stochastic number of times in the following month and that this information is available only at the end of the month.
